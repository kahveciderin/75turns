# 75turns

An online game. You begin with peasants that generate 100 gold per turn. You can buy more peasants with gold. You can use gold to increase peasant capacity, train soldiers or build other stuff. Enemies will come every turn and you will need soldiers to defend. The enemies become more difficult every turn so you will need to unlock new soldier types with gold by building the related building. The game's goal is to survive 75 turns.
